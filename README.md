# SNP HapMap and Expression Analysis
 
# Use correlation matrix.py to calculate Pearson's Correlation for environmental data. Remove environmental variables until no two variables have | r | ? 0.8 . Run correlation matrix.py with the filtered environmental data.

# Use Tassel 5 to output a CSV of the SNPs and correlations with environmental variables. Sort the CSV in ascending order of p values. Use calculate_FDR.py to output the SNPs with significantly associated SNPs after False Discovery Rate correction. Check where the SNPs fall in relation to the genes

# Download gene expression data from Medicago truncatula gene expression atlas. Use geneExpression.py to visualize expression.
